            <p>I have a strong academic foundation that equips me well for a Web Designer. I earned my bachelor
                in the
                field of
                information and technology from City of Malabon University in 2000. During my studies, I
                developed
                expertise in programming, making a database and especially in web designing that directly align
                with the
                role's
                requirements. My coursework in
                HCI and Web Development provided me with a solid understanding of making an appropriate and
                integrative
                websites.

                Additionally, I am a consistent honor student from primary up to tertiary education, and luckily
                graduated as
                cum laude, where I honed my skills in web creation. My capstone
                "Leveraging Data Analytics for Improved Consumer Behavior Insights", focused on the satisfaction
                of the
                consumers in the website, showcasing my ability to create a relevant and free for all website.
